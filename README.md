🌌 Mandeep’s Portfolio
🚀 About Me
I am a Computer Science Engineering student passionate about building functional, engaging apps and autonomous systems. With expertise across 30+ programming languages including Rust, Swift, Python, Go, Java, and C++, I design user-centric solutions that balance technical rigor with creativity.
Beyond development, I thrive as a mentor and communicator, simplifying complex concepts into clear, practical examples. My journey includes recognition as a Google Student Ambassador, participation in the Google AI Agents Intensive Course, and leadership roles such as GDG Lead & Core Contributor.
My portfolio is where technology meets creativity—from apps and robotics to teaching resources—always with the goal of making tech accessible, playful, and impactful.
